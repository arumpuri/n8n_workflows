# 🧠 n8n Workflows for Intelligent Automation

Welcome to my collection of **n8n workflows**! This repo contains a set of automation flows designed for various use cases—from ordinary task automation to more advanced **agentic workflows** and **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

This repository is organized into three main categories of workflows:

### 1. 🛠️ Ordinary Automation
These workflows handle routine tasks like:
- Parsing and responding to emails
- Saving attachments to cloud storage
- Scheduling recurring tasks or sending reminders

### 2. 🤖 Agentic Workflows
Agentic flows use **language models (LLMs)** to take dynamic action based on context. Examples include:
- Decision-making agents that choose actions based on input
- Smart assistants that can call APIs or services

### 3. 📚 Agentic RAG Workflows
These workflows combine **agents** with **retrieval mechanisms** to fetch relevant information before answering or acting. Ideal for:
- AI-powered email responders
- Knowledge-based chatbots
- Automated research pipelines
